# NEAR task repo

# npm install && npm run start 


# Includes the first login page (UI & some logic)


# Directory Structure
# src 
# components ( for reusable Button, Toggle etc)
# containers ( for routes like Splash or Login Page)

# RTK Query for data management
# Styled Components for Styles, Icons
# React-Router-Dom v6

# Note
# I worked 4 and a half hours on this task. Some of that was neccessary for setting up
# boilerplace etc and the rest I created the Login Page.
# I worked to show skills in TS and CSS also how I would manage the state and structure my code/files.

# Thank YOU
